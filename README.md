Coronavirus disease 2019 in short COVID-19 is a contagious disease caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which has caused a global pandemic and still infecting millions around the globe. COVID-19 has made an enormous impact on everybody’s day-to-day life. One of the main strengths of COVID-19 is its extraordinary infectious capability. Early detection systems can thus play a big role in curbing the exponential growth of COVID-19. Some medical radiography techniques, such as chest X-rays and chest CT scans, are used for fast and reliable detection of coronavirus-induced pneumonia. In this paper, we propose a histogram of oriented gradients and deep convolutional network-based model that can find out the specific abnormality in frontal chest X-ray images and effectively classify the data into COVID-19 positive, pneumonia positive, and normal classes. The proposed system performed effectively in terms of various performance measures and proved capable as an effective early detection system.
